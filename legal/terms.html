      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to VapeScout UK ("we", "our", "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website located at vapescout.co.uk (the "Service").</p>
      <p>By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not access the Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Age Restriction</h2>
      <p>Our Service is intended for adults aged 18 years and older only. By using this website, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age. We reserve the right to terminate access for anyone who misrepresents their age.</p>
      <p>VapeScout UK is a price comparison service for vaping products containing nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance. These products are intended for adult smokers and vapers only.</p>

      <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>VapeScout UK is a price comparison website that aggregates and displays e-liquid prices from various UK-based retailers. We do not sell any products directly. All purchases are made through third-party retailers.</p>
      <p>Our Service includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Price comparison for e-liquids and vaping products</li>
        <li>Links to third-party retailer websites</li>
        <li>Informational content and guides about vaping</li>
        <li>Price alert notifications (where opted in)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Affiliate Relationships</h2>
      <p>VapeScout UK participates in affiliate marketing programmes. This means we may earn a commission when you click through to a retailer and make a purchase. This commission comes from the retailer, not from you, and does not affect the price you pay.</p>
      <p>Our affiliate relationships include but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Awin affiliate network</li>
        <li>Direct partnerships with vape retailers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While we strive to provide accurate pricing information, we cannot guarantee that all prices are current or that all products are in stock. Always verify prices on the retailer's website before making a purchase.</p>

      <h2>5. Accuracy of Information</h2>
      <p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of the information on our website, including product prices, descriptions, and retailer details. However, we do not warrant that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All information is accurate, complete, or current</li>
        <li>Prices displayed will match those on retailer websites</li>
        <li>Products shown are in stock at all retailers</li>
        <li>Promotional offers are still valid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pricing information is updated regularly but may not reflect real-time changes. Always confirm the final price with the retailer before completing your purchase.</p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Websites</h2>
      <p>Our Service contains links to third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by VapeScout UK. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites.</p>
      <p>When you click a link to a retailer website, you are leaving VapeScout UK and are subject to that retailer's terms and conditions. We strongly advise you to read the terms and privacy policy of any third-party website you visit.</p>

      <h2>7. User Conduct</h2>
      <p>When using our Service, you agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to our systems</li>
        <li>Use automated tools to scrape or extract data without permission</li>
        <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service</li>
        <li>Impersonate any person or entity</li>
        <li>Transmit any viruses, malware, or harmful code</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Loss of profits or revenue</li>
